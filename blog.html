        <h3><i data-lucide="clapperboard" class="icon"></i> Thoughts on Coogler’s New Movie</h3>
        <p>I’m still buzzing from the sound and rhythm of this film — the way the music hits, I feel like it’s going to stay with me for days.</p>

        <p>Ryan Coogler calls this his most personal film, and yeah, you can feel that from the first few scenes. It’s packed with bits and pieces from his family’s history — from blues records passed down by his uncle, to deep southern tales about bootleggers, old clubs, and the kind of stories that get told at 3 a.m. when no one’s quite sober. And then just for good measure… there are vampires.</p>

        <p>There’s one moment in the middle — a scene that plays like a time-traveling jam session — that honestly floored me. It ties music across generations in this beautifully surreal way. But weirdly, that idea just… disappears. Like the movie brings up this genius concept and then doesn’t know what to do with it.</p>

        <p>The whole thing feels like several movies mashed together — and I mean that in both a chaotic and fun way. There’s the story about the bluesman who might have magic in his hands, the one about Black brothers hustling gangsters, the underground juke joint fighting white supremacy, even a wild subplot about an Irish vampire obsessed with vinyl. Any one of those could’ve been its own film, but here they all just tumble over each other.</p>

        <p>That said — I kind of loved it for that. It’s unpredictable, loud, messy, but full of heart. Like a playlist that jumps from Delta blues to grunge to Irish folk without warning… which, funnily enough, is exactly what the soundtrack does.</p>

    <h3><i data-lucide="film" class="icon"></i> My First Paid Gig (And How I Screwed Up the Audio)</h3>
    <p>This was supposed to be easy. Just film a promo for a local café — few shots of coffee pouring, some hipster latte art, happy customers, done in an hour. I even brought my tripod this time. I thought I was on top of it.</p>

    <p>Everything went smoothly while I was shooting. The lighting was decent, the staff were friendly, and I got some solid b-roll. It wasn’t until I got home and started editing that I realized the entire audio track — including the interview with the owner — had this weird hum in the background. Like a low drone that made it sound like I was filming next to a washing machine.</p>

    <p>I tried everything. Noise reduction, EQ tricks, even AI audio cleanup. It helped, but it still wasn’t great. And yeah, I panicked a little.</p>

    <p>In the end, I sent them two versions — one with the original audio and one with just music and subtitles. They actually liked the stylized version more (thank god), but I still felt like I blew it.</p>

    <p>So yeah, first paid job = humbling experience. What did I learn? Always, always monitor your audio. Test it in the space. Use headphones. Don’t assume it’s working just because your mic has a little green light on it.</p>

    <p>I still cringe when I hear that hum. But I think I’ll remember this gig longer than any future one that goes perfectly. At least I got a free cappuccino out of it.</p>
